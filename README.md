# RoboPod
RoboPod is a containerized ROS2-based project for the iCreate3 robot, built with C++ and managed using Podman. This project provides a lightweight and portable setup to easily develop, test, and deploy robotics applications in a containerized environment.

## Getting Started

It basically ties down to the wonderful documentation form iRobot

1. [iCreate3 Docs](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/)
2. [Python iRobot Playground](https://python.irobot.com/)
3. [iRobot Github](https://github.com/iRobotEducation)

In the Github there are already docker images to run Create3 applications,
but there always room to expand such as adding deep learning libraries and
frameworks.
